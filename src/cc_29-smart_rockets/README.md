# Coding Challenge #29 - Smart Rockets

- A rocket has an array of random vectors
- These vectors represent the rocket's path through the screen
- The closer the rocket gets to the target, the higher its fitness (its probability of giving birth to a child)
- If the rocket crashes (hits an obstacle or go outside the screen), it's fitness is decreased a lot
